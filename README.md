# Amazon-web-scraper

#### In this project, I have used BeautifulSoup to scrape the [Amazon India](https://www.amazon.in/) webpage using BeautifulSoup

The user is asked to enter the category of products they want to search and the program will retrieve a top 10 list. The user can then get more information about any of the products in the list.

I am open to contributions as it would benefit a lot and help me learn as well.

**Thankyou!**
